Centromere_repeat_paper
=======================

Code in this repository was used to generate and analyse data for our analysis of 
centromeric repeats, as described in this paper:

[Comparative analysis of tandem repeats from hundreds of species reveals unique insights into centromere evolution](http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/1/R10/abstract)
Genome Biology 2013, *14*:R10

Much of this code concerns fetching sequence data from the Trace Archive and processing
it with TRF (tandem repeat finder).
